## Hi there 👋

I'm Ganti Padma Priya.

I'm a Computer Science student interested in software development and backend systems.
I enjoy building small projects to understand how software works internally and to
strengthen problem-solving skills.

- Focusing on core software development concepts
- Gaining hands-on experience through backend and networking projects
- Interested in software engineering roles and learning from real-world systems

Open to internships and opportunities to learn and grow as a software engineer...
