## Hi there 👋

I'm Priya.

I'm a Computer Science student interested in software development and
backend/system-level concepts. I like understanding how software works
internally rather than just using frameworks.

- Focusing on core software development concepts
- Exploring backend logic through hands-on projects
- Interested in building reliable and efficient applications

Thanks for visiting my profile.
